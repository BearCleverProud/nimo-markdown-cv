## Research Experience

### **the Johns Hopkins University, Centre for Language and Speech Processing** `2019.9 - 2020.7`

_Undergraduate Research supervised by Dr. [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/)_<br>
- Studied and implemented **Word2Vec**, **Multilingual Word Embedding**, **Orthogonalisation** and **Normalisation** <br>
- Turned the pure **linear mapping** into **non‐linear mapping** to enhance the **expressiveness** of the model <br>
- Modified to the network structure, improved all language pairs accuracy by **4%** with **initial dictionary** <br>

### **Harbin Institute of Technology, Centre for Social Computing and Information Retrieval(SCIR)** `2017.3 - 2017.8`

_Undergraduate Research supervised by Dr. [Weinan Zhang](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~wnzhang/)_<br>
- Style transfer is to transfer a text into another style while **preserving its meaning**(e.g. ”I like this” ‐> ”Omg!!! I really like this!!!”) <br>
- Applied **back translation** with different back-translation **decoders** to generate different styles <br>
- Employed revised **seq2seq** model, **reinforcement learning** and **GANs** <br>

## Project

Building an Intelligent Platform for Teachers and Students `JHU, 2020.3 - 2020.5` <br>
- Built a system which could **link the problem to the corresponding chapters** from the textbook <br>
- Tried to use **BERT** to calculate the **sentence probability** but it turned out to be too **time-consuming**<br>
- Used **Topic Modelling** in the final product <br>

Amazon Review Prediction, `JHU, 2020.4 - 2020.5` <br>
- Built a system which predicts the **rating of a comment text** <br>
- Built a system which predicts the **potential categories the costumer will probably buy** according to the purchase history <br>

Super Mario Reinforcement Learning Project `JHU, 2020.4 - 2020.5` <br>
- Built a neural network using **Proximal Policy Optimization**, which enables the Mario agent to finish world 1 level 1 <br>
- Trained Mario to kill **as many monsters as possible**
